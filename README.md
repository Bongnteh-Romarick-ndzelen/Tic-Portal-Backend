# TIV Portal Backend

This is the backend API for the TIC Portal built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

1. **Download or clone this project from GitHub**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bongnteh-Romarick-ndzelen/Tic-Portal-Backend

2.  **Navigate into the project directory**
### cd tic-portal-backend


3. **Install dependencies**
 ## npm install

4. **Create a .env file and add:**
   
   <!-- PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.ie18wqq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
    JWT_SECRET="F7jU$9dF!e8Dq#n3R9gT2lZwV@KxA4" -->

5. Run the server
   ## npm run dev 

6. üß™ Testing the API with Postman
Use Postman to test the following endpoints:

Note: For protected routes, you must first log in and include the JWT token in the Authorization header as:
Bearer <your_token>

üßç Authentication
| Method | Endpoint           | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/auth/signup` | Register a new user      |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`  | Login user and get token |

üìö Courses (Instructor Only)
| Method | Endpoint           | Description             |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/courses`     | Create a new course     |
| GET    | `/api/courses`     | Get all courses         |
| GET    | `/api/courses/:id` | Get single course by ID |
| PUT    | `/api/courses/:id` | Update course by ID     |
| DELETE | `/api/courses/:id` | Delete course by ID     |

Course Object Example:
{
  "title": "Web Development Fundamentals",
  "description": "Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.",
  "category": "Web Development",
  "videoUrl": "https://example.com/myvideo.mp4", // optional
  "docPath": "/docs/course-guide.pdf"           // optional
}

üîê Auth Middleware
The API includes a middleware to protect routes and restrict actions to instructors (e.g. creating a course).

üìé Notes
Only users with role "instructor" can create, update, or delete courses.

All video extensions and document formats are allowed (handled as optional fields).

7. Enrollment
 ### A. Enroll in a course ###
Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments/<COURSE_ID>

Headers:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token> //Your login token

Body: (none needed)

‚úÖ Sample Response:
{
  "message": "Enrollment successful",
  "enrollment": {
    "_id": "662d923b4f0f0e34b8d112b4",
    "student": "662d91f84f0f0e34b8d112a9",
    "course": "662d920e4f0f0e34b8d112b1",
    "progress": 0,
    "enrolledAt": "2025-05-15T15:50:35.844Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
}


# View Enrollments
Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/enrollments

## TIPS #
‚úÖ Common Mistakes to Avoid
üîí Make sure the JWT token is sent as Bearer <token> in Authorization header.

üßë The user must be of type "student" (or anyone allowed to enroll).

üéØ Use the actual course ID from MongoDB when making the request.

## INSTRUCTOR ONLY TO ACCESS STUDENTS OR PEOPLE ENROLL IN THEIR COURSE
| Method | Route                                     | Access       | Purpose                               |
| Enroll in a course                    |
| GET    | `/api/enrollments/my-courses/enrollments` | Instructor   | See who enrolled in their own courses |
